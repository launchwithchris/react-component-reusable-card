Create a new MainGoal component which outputs a paragraph of text that describes your main course goal (e.g., "My main goal: Learn React in-depth and from the ground up").

You'll have to create this new component from scratch and then use it inside the App component's JSX code.

The finished app could look like this:

(notice the "My main goal: Learn react from the ground up" text at the bottom)

Important: To ensure that the automatic checks correctly detect your solution, your component must be called MainGoal and it also must be exported. To do that, simply add the export keyword in front of your MainGoal component.

The MainGoal component also must contain the text "My main goal:" (followed by whatever your main course goal is).
